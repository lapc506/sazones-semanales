# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate fluent_ui with the existing flutter_platform_widgets implementation to provide native Windows Fluent Design System widgets when the app runs on Windows platform. This will enhance the user experience by providing platform-appropriate UI components that follow Microsoft's design guidelines while maintaining cross-platform compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Windows user, I want the app to use native Fluent Design System widgets, so that the interface feels familiar and consistent with other Windows applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app runs on Windows THEN the system SHALL use fluent_ui widgets instead of Material widgets
2. WHEN the app runs on non-Windows platforms THEN the system SHALL continue using the existing Material/Cupertino widgets
3. WHEN switching between platforms THEN the system SHALL maintain the same functionality across all UI components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to extend flutter_platform_widgets to support fluent_ui, so that I can maintain a single codebase while providing platform-specific UI experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing platform widgets THEN the system SHALL provide a fluent_ui option alongside Material and Cupertino
2. WHEN configuring platform styles THEN the system SHALL allow setting Windows to use Fluent style
3. WHEN creating new platform widgets THEN the system SHALL support fluent_ui implementations through dependency inversion

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent theming across all platforms, so that the app maintains visual coherence while respecting platform conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying themes THEN the system SHALL map the existing color scheme to fluent_ui theme properties
2. WHEN using system accent colors THEN the system SHALL integrate with Windows system theme settings
3. WHEN switching between light and dark modes THEN the system SHALL properly apply fluent_ui theme variants

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain existing functionality, so that the integration doesn't break current features or require extensive refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating fluent_ui THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing navigation patterns
2. WHEN using platform widgets THEN the system SHALL maintain the same API surface for all components
3. WHEN building the app THEN the system SHALL minimize changes to existing screen implementations and provide clear migration paths where changes are needed
