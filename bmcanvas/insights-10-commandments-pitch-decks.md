## Understanding the Core of Your Pitch

It all starts with getting to the heart of what you're doing.

**Kick Off with the Problem**: Don't just jump into your solution. Instead, begin by clearly defining the problem you're trying to solve. You need to show your audience just how urgent and widespread this issue is, backing it up with solid evidence.

**Introduce Your Solution**: Once you've laid out the problem, present your solution. Make sure it directly addresses the pain points you just described. What's your unique take, your special insight that makes your approach stand out?

**Show You're 10x Better**: Your product or service can't just be a little bit better than what's out there. It needs to be significantly superior—think an order of magnitude, or 10 times better. This "10x" improvement could be in the product itself, your business model, pricing, or something else entirely.

**Calculate Your Market Size (TAM) from the Ground Up**: When talking about your Total Addressable Market (TAM), skip those vague, top-down market reports. Instead, calculate it bottoms-up by multiplying your potential customers by your sales price. This gives a much more realistic and defensible number.

**Visualize Your Competition with a Table**: Forget those simplistic "magic quadrants" for showing competitors. A simple table is far more effective. List your top competitors and then break down measurable benefits, prioritizing what truly matters. This offers a much clearer comparison.

**Be Specific About How You'll Reach Customers**: Your go-to-market strategy shouldn't just be "direct sales." Get specific about who your target customers are, why they matter, and how that translates into your key customer segments. How exactly will you reach them?

**Demo Your Product with Real-World Use Cases**: When you demo your product, focus on specific use cases. Show how it solves particular problems for different user roles, highlighting the top benefits rather than just listing features.

**Present Realistic Forecasts and Financials**: When it comes to your forecasts and financials, honesty is key. Don't just say your numbers are "conservative." Instead, state your confidence level and clearly outline the top assumptions behind your estimates.

**Frame Your Fundraising Ask Around Milestones**: When you're asking for money, don't just talk about how many months of runway it will buy you. Instead, focus on the measurable milestones you'll achieve with those funds. Investors are buying into your progress and goals, not just time.

**Your Vision Isn't Your Exit Strategy (Especially Early On)**: For companies in earlier stages (pre-Series C), your vision should be about how you're going to dominate your market in the next 3-5 years. It's not the time to talk about your exit strategy; that comes much later.

## Extra Tips for a Stronger Pitch

The video also provides a few bonus tips that can really make a difference:

**Lead with Traction If You Have It**: If your startup has traction, bring it up within the first five minutes of your pitch. It's incredibly strong evidence that your idea has merit and can immediately grab investor attention.

**Ensure Your ARR Is Truly Recurring**: For businesses with Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), be sure the revenue you report genuinely recurs annually. Don't include things like trials, one-time services, or hardware sales in your ARR figures.

**Be Clear About Your Team**: On your team slide, make sure you clearly distinguish between full-time employees, part-time staff, and advisors. This transparency is appreciated.

Ultimately, applying these commandments isn't just about crafting a better pitch deck; it leads to a much improved business strategy and a more compelling story for potential investors. There are even deeper-dive videos available for each commandment if you want to explore them further!
